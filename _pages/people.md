##### <span style="color: #0faddd;; font-weight: bold;"> Before You Read Below: </span>

I am glad you’re interested enough to reach this part of the website. However, before you read further and consider applying to work with us at IIT Roorkee ore remotely, I’d like to offer a gentle warning.

We are a group of individuals obsessed with research, progress, outcomes, and Vyaktitva Nirman (व्यक्तित्व निर्माण) — the continuous development of one’s character and capabilities. Every member of $$\mathcal{P}^2$$ Lab works tirelessly to build a _culture of excellence_ that pushes beyond personal limits. _We politely but firmly refuse to be just another place for collecting degrees or certificates_. We ask the most obvious yet overlooked research questions, take on difficult but pertinent problems, acknowledge our current limitations, and work relentlessly to overcome them. We follow a simple but strict code of ethics, and _every member_ is held to the same standards of performance and behavior. No one works _under anyone_ here — we all work _with_ each other, each carrying different responsibilities within our projects.

In short, $$\mathcal{P}^2$$ Lab is not the place for those seeking easy rewards or comfort zones — it’s the place for the outliers and mavericks, the ones who dare to build, question, and grow-- together.


##### <span style="color: #0faddd;; font-weight: bold;"> For Prospective Students:   </span>


I am currently seeking PhD candidates for the Spring Semester 2025-26 (December Intake) through the Electrical Engineering admission process at IIT Roorkee. Please refer to the application guidelines available [here](https://iitr.ac.in/Academics/Admission%20To%20Doctoral%20Programmes.html). 

I encourage applicants with backgrounds in electrical engineering, operations research, and applied machine learning to apply. I am particularly interested in students who are eager to develop expertise to address complex challenges in power engineering via $$\large Power+AI$$ route. In my experience, it is often more effective to teach the specifics of power engineering to individuals with strong mathematical, computational, or operational research backgrounds than vice versa.

Please feel free to email me at [here](mailto:pareek@ee.iitr.ac.in) with the subject line “Prospective Doctoral Student Application December 2025 - [Your Name]”, including a brief overview of your interests and how you would contribute to our research group. Try and review a few of the resources given below before writing to me. Attach your CV and any other relevant documents. If you do not receive a response, please do not hesitate to follow up.

 **<span style="color:rgba(223, 172, 21, 1);"> I will not able to be able to accomodate more undergraduate or postgraduate researchers from IITR at this time, though we greatly appreciate the enthusiasm.</span>**

<!-- If you are a current IIT Roorkee undergraduate or postgraduate student, write to me [here](mailto:pareek@ee.iitr.ac.in). You can also visit me at my office: 214A, East Wing, EE Building, preferably with prior appointment. I have exciting opportunities to work on projects related to machine learning and quantum computing applications for power system analysis, optimization and other engineering projects. Note that candidates may be required to complete a _test project_ as part of the selection process. **Important:** Any email that does not clearly mention _Research Internship Inquiry IITR Student_ in the subject line will not be entertained and will be discarded. -->

##### <span style="color: #0faddd;; font-weight: bold;"> Internship Opportunities for External Students: </span>
I have limited opportunities for summer internships at $$\mathcal{P}^2$$ Lab in the upcoming summer (2026) for projects related to machine learning applications in power system analysis, optimization, and other engineering domains. Students from outside IIT Roorkee can reach out to me at [here](mailto:pareek@ee.iitr.ac.in) for more details. Early movers get priority consideration! We are not accepting applications for Winter internships at this time.
