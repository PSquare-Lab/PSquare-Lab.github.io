**For Prospective Students:** I am currently seeking PhD candidates for Autumn Semester 2025 (July Intake) through the Electrical Engineering admission process at IIT Roorkee. Please refer to the application guidelines available [here](https://iitr.ac.in/Academics/Admission%20To%20Doctoral%20Programmes.html). 

I encourage applicants with backgrounds in electrical engineering, operations research, and applied machine learning to apply. I am particularly interested in students who are eager to develop expertise to address complex challenges in power engineering via $$\large Power+AI$$ route. In my experience, it is often more effective to teach the specifics of power engineering to individuals with strong mathematical, computational, or operational research backgrounds than vice versa.

Please feel free to email me at [here](mailto:pareek@ee.iitr.ac.in) with the subject line “Propective Masters/Doctoral Student Application Autumn 2025 - [Your Name]”, including a brief overview of your interests and how you would contribute to our research group. Try and review a few of the resources given below before writing to me. Attach your CV and any other relevant documents. If you do not receive a response, please do not hesitate to follow up.

**Existing IITR UG & PG: Currently, we are not looking for more undergraduate researchers from IITR.**

<!-- If you are a current IIT Roorkee undergraduate or postgraduate student, write to me [here](mailto:pareek@ee.iitr.ac.in). You can also visit me at my office: 214A, East Wing, EE Building, preferably with prior appointment. I have exciting opportunities to work on projects related to machine learning and quantum computing applications for power system analysis, optimization and other engineering projects. Note that candidates may be required to complete a _test project_ as part of the selection process. **Important:** Any email that does not clearly mention _Research Internship Inquiry IITR Student_ in the subject line will not be entertained and will be discarded. -->

**Internship Opportunities for External Students:** I have limited opportunities for summer internships in the upcoming summer for projects related to machine learning applications in power system analysis, optimization, and other engineering domains. Students from outside IIT Roorkee can reach out to me at [here](mailto:pareek@ee.iitr.ac.in) for more details. Early movers get priority consideration!


**Some Relevent Resources:** 

- Seminar Series : [enOPTIMAL](https://wdvorkin.github.io/enoptimal/), [DTU PES Summer School](https://www.youtube.com/@dtulecturesonpowerenergysy8133/videos), ...


- Some Papers : [Optimal Power Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00943),  [Gaussian Process for Power Flow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GfyVgx-ca9QEpgm7mg8yHzbKsYY3ifnE/view), [Power System Optimization under Uncertainty](https://pscc-central.epfl.ch/repo/papers/2022/22730.pdf), [End-to-End Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16378), ...
