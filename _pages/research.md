<!-- <span style="color: #ff6600; font-size: 24px;">Selected Research Works</span> -->
My research interests lie in exploring solutions at the intersection of power systems, optimization, machine learning, and more recently, quantum computing, to address the challenges of modern energy networks, particularly under uncertainty.

We aim to enhance the **reliability**, **efficiency**, and **resilience** of energy networks operating under uncertainty by developing **problem-specific ML tools**. 


**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Probabilistic and Non-Parametric Methods:</span>** Group will focus on advancing probabilistic methods and non-parametric techniques to create robust and interpretable models for **Medium to Long Term Planning** & **Cause-Effect Studies** in renewable energy-dominated Indian power grids. By addressing the complexities introduced by renewable integration, we aim to enhance grid reliability and operational efficiency.


**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Quantum Computing Potential Exploration:</span>** Group will **investigate the capabilities of** quantum computing in solving computationally combursome problems in power grids & other engineering domains. The aim will be to scrutinizing and advance the boundaries of what's possible using Quantum computing for **Our Favourite Problems**.



Below is a brief non-rigorous summary and the associated papers related to above mentioned three main research themes.

Closed-form power flow (CFPF) framework aim to provide **explicit** mathematical expressions for solving AC power flow equations: $$V = f(\mathbf{s})$$ (Node voltage as a function of injection vector). The core idea is to bypas iterative numerical techniques like Newton-Raphson and replace these with **function evaluation**. Unlike linearizations, CFPF is a general framework which allows to tailor complexity of $$f(\mathbf{s})$$ based on target application. Desired features of CFPF are:

- **Flexible Forms** $$\implies$$ Non-linear forms with *complexity-accuracy* trade-off
- **Easy to Evaluate Forms** $$\implies$$ Faster numerical calculations
- **Non-parametric Forms** $$\implies$$ Works within a power injection range or hypercube
- **Differentiability of Forms** $$\implies$$ Can be fed into optimization problems
- **Interpretability of Forms** $$\implies$$ Should provide insights into the physical system

The CFPF framework is build using **Gaussian Process** (GPs) to achieve these desired features. Beyond direct applications, **Vertex-Degree-Kernel** (VDK) design has been proposed for scaling the GPs to larger grid. Some key innovations involve designing a  **Network-Swipe Active Learning algorithm**, **Multi-Task VDK GP** and **Theoretical Learning Bounds for Risk Analysis**.
